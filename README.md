# Chinook Digital Media Store  

## 1. Background & Overview
Digital media platforms generate large volumes of transactional data from customer purchases, content catalogs, and employee operations. While transactional (OLTP) databases are effective for daily operations, they are not optimized for analytical queries such as customer behavior analysis, sales trends, or product performance evaluation.

This project uses the **Chinook Digital Media Store dataset** to demonstrate how sound **data modeling** and **data warehouse design** can transform raw transactional data into a structure optimized for analytics and business intelligence.

Rather than focusing on advanced machine learning, the project emphasizes:
- Relational data modeling principles  
- Referential integrity and business rules  
- Star and snowflake schema design  
- Business-driven analytical use cases  

**Core Business Question**  
> How can a transactional digital media database be transformed into a scalable data warehouse that supports efficient, insight-driven analytics?
